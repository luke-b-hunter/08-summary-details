A special ocassion will be taking place on Slovenian street on 6th of June. Not like something you've ever seen before! A performance by the strange movement that calles itself Uličníci *(Rascals)* will appear on Slovenian street next to the park on Cech Square. What is this movement and why are they doing this? The movement is touching the subject of frivolous politics together with real problems in our streets, believe or not! The goal of this self proclaimed movement is to bring peace in the streets with these bizzare performances. Will they achieve their "peace?" According to the movement, the upcoming peformance is the first of their many goals they want to achieve. According to the movement's platform, which you can find on their social media and their web page, the goal of this performace is to get rid of Slovaks in Slovenian street so the names don't get confused anymore! And apparently, thanks to this there will be more room for people to live. How smart! So that's the problem they"re focusing this performance on. Well I wish the actors good luck with that. But let's take a deeper look on what's actually going to be happening.
